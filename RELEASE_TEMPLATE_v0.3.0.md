# cc-worktree-squad v0.3.0

## Highlights

- Added `ccws standup` for quick cross-session progress reports
- Added `--files` to control changed-file preview length per session
- Added per-session summary fields: last commit, staged/unstaged/untracked counts

## Quick start

```bash
ccws standup
ccws standup --files 5
```

## Why this matters

You can now run a practical "daily standup" across all active worktree sessions in one command.
